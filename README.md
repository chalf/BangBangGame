# BangBangGame
A game application that simulates the game of the same name that I loved when I was a teenager.
A fun tank shooting game with fresh and easy-to-see graphics. Also this is the major project I had to do as a third-year student.

## Set up
I use g++ compiler version 8.1.0 and SDL2 library version 2.0.10 with extensions sdl2_image (2.0.5), sdl2_mixer (2.0.4) and SDL2_ttf (2.0.12). For programming, I use Sublime Text.
All libraries are included in `libs.rar` file. Just unzip it in the folder where it is located.
